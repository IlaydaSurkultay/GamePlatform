                Game Rules:
                Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle.
                Player 1 uses the W and S keys, while Player 2 uses the arrow keys.
                The goal is to hit the ball past your opponent's paddle to score points.
                First player to reach a certain score wins the game.
